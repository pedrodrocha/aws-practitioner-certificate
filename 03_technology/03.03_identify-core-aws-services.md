# Identify the core AWS services

## Describe the categories of services on AWS (compute, storage, network, database)

## Identify AWS compute services

### **Recognize there are different compute families**

### **Recognize the different services that provide compute** 

for example, AWS Lambda compared to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), or Amazon EC2, etc.)



**AWS Lambda** is a manage AWS service that allows a customer to craft custom functions to carry out any task written in a variety of programming languages. Lambda is available as a hosted service at each edge location.

### **Recognize that elasticity is achieved through Auto Scaling**

Real-time monitoring of a hosted cloud application allows AWS to react almost instantaneously before the application's performance is close to degrading. 

**EC2 Auto Scaling** > Additional computer resources are automatically ordered and delivered to the application server's cluster maintaining the server performance.

*Rapid elasticity based on demand is only possible with real-time monitoring driving automated scale*

### **Identify the purpose of load balancers**


## **Identify different AWS storage services**
## **Describe Amazon S3**
## **Describe Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)**
## **Describe Amazon S3 Glacier**
## **DescriCbe AWS Snowball**
## **Describe Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)**
## **Describe AWS Storage Gateway**



## Identify AWS networking services

### **Identify VPC**

### **Identify security groups**

### **Identify the purpose of Amazon Route 53**

As a customer access an application hosted at AWS, an application query will be carried out. This is accomplished using DNS (Domain Name System).

Route 53 is Amazon's hosted DNS service.

Route 53 has a public side pointed to the public edge locations that accepts incoming customer requests and then resolves each query to the requested AWS resource located on Route 53's private side.


### **Identify VPN, AWS Direct Connect**
