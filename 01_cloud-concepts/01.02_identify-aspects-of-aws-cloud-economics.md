# Identify aspects of AWS Cloud economics

## Define items that would be part of a Total Cost of Ownership proposal

### **Understand the role of operational expenses (OpEx)** = **RENT**

Operational expenses are **all you pay for using cloud services**.

### **Understand the role of capital expenses (CapEx)** = **BUY**

Capital expenses is defined as **business expenses incurred in order to create long-term benefits in the future**.

### **Understand labor costs associated with on-premises operations**

### **Understand the impact of software licensing costs when moving to the cloud**

A consumer don't have to pay for many software licenses at the processer level because he is not responsible for running hypervisor services; that's Amazon's job

### **Identify which operations will reduce costs by moving to the cloud**

### **Right-sized infrastructure**

Underutilized servers in on-premise data centers are expensive to run and maintain. Because you no longer host as many physical servers, your total hosting costs (heating, cooling, and so on) will be lower as well

### **Benefits of automation**

### **Reduce compliance scope (for example, reporting)**

### **Managed services (for example, RDS, ECS, EKS, DynamoDB)**
