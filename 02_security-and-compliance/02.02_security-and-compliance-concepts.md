# Define AWS Cloud security and compliance concepts



## Identify where to find AWS compliance information

AWS operates in many different countries and its subject to a variety of rules and regulations enforced by governments and compliance standards.

Also, depending on the type of business a customer operate, there are possibly many different levels of compliance he need to adhere to when operating in the AWS cloud.



### Locations of lists of recognized available compliance controls (for example, HIPPA, SOCs)

Once you sign on as an AWS customer, you have access to the compliance reports aligned with the standards, certifications, or attestations that Amazon has currently achieved and maintains.

All current compliance certifications and attestations that AWS is aligned with are audited and assessed using third-party independent auditors.

AWS has ben successfully audited against several compliance standards such as:

- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)**: Secures the privacy of individual health information records in the United States
- **Gramm-Leachy-Billy Act (GLBA)**: mandates protection of customer information by financial industries.
- **Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)**: ensures the integrity of financial operations of publicly traded companies
- **PCI DSS**: ensures the processing integrity of credit card data or authentication data
- **GDPR**: protects privacy and personal data for all citizens of the EU


### Recognize that compliance requirements vary among AWS services



## At a high level, describe how customers achieve compliance on AWS
### Identify different encryption options on AWS (for example, In transit, At rest)

## Describe who enables encryption on AWS for a given service
## Recognize there are services that will aid in auditing and reporting
### Recognize that logs exist for auditing and monitoring (do not have to understand the logs)
## Define Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config, and AWS CloudTrail

### **Amazon CloudWatch**

### **AWS Config**

AWS Config gives costumers the ability to monitor the configuration of their IaaS resources such as compute, networking, and monitoring against a set of customer-defined rules and capture any changes to the resource's configuration

AWS Config charges for:
- the number of configuration items being monitored in an account, per region
- the number of custom rules a customer defines

Results gathered by AWS Config are stored in an S3 bucket.

AWS Config is also integrated with CloudWatch and send detailed information about all configuration changes and notifications to CloudWatch events. An event is anything that happened that you should know about.


### **AWS CloudTrail**



### Explain the concept of least privileged access
