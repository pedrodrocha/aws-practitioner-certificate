# Identify resources for security support

## Recognize there are different network security capabilities

### **Native AWS services** 

#### *a) Security Groups*
#### *b) Network ACLs*
#### *c) AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)*

WAF can custom filter incoming (ingress) publich traffic requests at Layer 7 for HTTP and HTTPS requests. The goal is to limit any malicious requests from getting any further into AWS infrastructure to the edge location

WAF rules can be applied to public-facing Application Load Balancers and CloudFront distributions.

WAF rules can be managed accross multiple AWS accounts and resources using the AWS Firewall Manager.

Supported behaviors:
- **Block requests from specific attackers, or attacks**: Block specific IP addresses, countries...
- **Serve restricted content to specific users**: for example, restrict content to users from a specific IP address range
- **Monitor incoming requests properties for analysis**


### **3rd party security products from the AWS Marketplace**


## Recognize there is documentation and where to find it (for example, best practices, whitepapers, official documents)

### AWS Knowledge Center, Security Center, security forum, and security blogs

### Partner Systems Integrators

## Know that security checks are a component of AWS Trusted Advisor
