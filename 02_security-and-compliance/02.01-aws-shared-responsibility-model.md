# Define the AWS shared responsibility model

The **Service Level Agreement** (SLA) specifies what services are providades and at what specific operational level. There will be details about acceptable outage time, the responsibility of the cloud provider when outages occur, and statements about not being responsible for events outside AWS control.

The consumer must fully understand what each cloud service offered provides; this is exactly what the cloud service will and will not do.

At Amazon, each service may have a separate SLA, but some services don't have a specific SLA at all.So, before considering the SLA, you should understand the *AWS Customer Agreement* for a big picture.


## Recognize the elements of the Shared Responsibility Model

## Describe the customerâ€™s responsibly on AWS and how they may shift depending on the service used

**OBS**: Everything fails all the time, and is the consumer responsibility to design its application to be able to continue operating even if compute and storage failures occur

According to the AWS Customer Agreement the main customer responsibilities are:
- Accounts
- Content
- Security settings
- Backup
- Login credentials
- Logon keys
- Actions of end users working with AWS services that are the customer's responsibility

## Describe AWS responsibilities

### **Overall service operation and deployment**

### **Service orchestration**

### **Overall management of the cloud**

### **Security of the cloud components**

### **Maintenance of customer privacy**
